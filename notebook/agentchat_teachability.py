# # Chatting with TeachableAgent
# 
# Conversational assistants based on LLMs can remember the current chat with the user, and can even demonstrate in-context learning of things that the user teaches the assistant during the chat. But these memories and learnings are lost once the chat is over, or when a single chat grows too long for the LLM to handle effectively. In subsequent chats, the user is forced to repeat any necessary instructions over and over.
# 
# `TeachableAgent` addresses these limitations by persisting user teachings across chat boundaries in long-term memory (a vector database). Memory is saved to disk at the end of each chat, then loaded from disk at the start of the next. Instead of copying all of memory into the context window, which would eat up valuable space, individual memories (called memos) are retrieved into context as needed. This allows the user to teach frequently used facts and skills to the teachable agent just once, and have it remember them in later chats.
# 
# In making decisions about memo storage and retrieval, `TeachableAgent` calls an instance of `TextAnalyzerAgent` to analyze pieces of text in several different ways. This adds extra LLM calls involving a relatively small number of tokens. These calls can add a few seconds to the time a user waits for a response.
# 
# This notebook demonstrates how `TeachableAgent` can learn facts, preferences, and skills from users. To chat with `TeachableAgent` yourself, run [chat_with_teachable_agent.py](../test/agentchat/chat_with_teachable_agent.py).
# 
# ## Requirements
# 
# AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install the [teachable] option.
# ```bash
# pip install "pyautogen[teachable]"
# ```

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('capture', '--no-stderr', '# %pip install "pyautogen[teachable]\n')


# ## Set your API Endpoint
# 
# The [`config_list_from_json`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/reference/oai/openai_utils#config_list_from_json) function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or a json file.

# In[1]:


import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    file_location=".",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4", "gpt4", "gpt-4-32k"],
    },
)

print(config_list[0]["model"])


# It first looks for environment variable "OAI_CONFIG_LIST" which needs to be a valid json string. If that variable is not found, it then looks for a json file named "OAI_CONFIG_LIST". It filters the configs by models (you can filter by other keys as well). After application of this particular filter, only the gpt-4 models are kept.
# 
# The config list looks like the following:
# ```python
# config_list = [
#     {
#         'model': 'gpt-4',
#         'api_key': '<your OpenAI API key here>',
#     },
#     {
#         'model': 'gpt-4',
#         'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
#         'api_base': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
#         'api_type': 'azure',
#         'api_version': '2023-06-01-preview',
#     },
#     {
#         'model': 'gpt-4-32k',
#         'api_key': '<your Azure OpenAI API key here>',
#         'api_base': '<your Azure OpenAI API base here>',
#         'api_type': 'azure',
#         'api_version': '2023-06-01-preview',
#     },
# ]
# ```
# 
# If you open this notebook in colab, you can upload your files by clicking the file icon on the left panel and then choose "upload file" icon.
# 
# You can set the value of config_list in other ways if you prefer, e.g., loading from a YAML file.

# ## Construct Agents
# For this walkthrough, we start by resetting the teachable agent's memory store. This deletes any memories from prior conversations that may be stored on disk.

# Now let's start a new chat by clearing the previous chat's history. At this point, common LLM-based assistants would forget everything from the last chat. But `TeachableAgent` can retrieve memories from its vector DB as needed, allowing it to recall and reason over facts that the user taught it in earlier conversations.

text = "How does the Vicuna model compare to the Orca model?"

# ## Learning user preferences
# Now let's teach the agent some of our preferences. Suppose that we frequently post short summaries of new papers for our team to read, and we want the teachable agent to help us do this faster.

AutoGen is an open-source framework that allows developers to build LLM applications via multiple agents that can converse with each other to accomplish tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. Using AutoGen, developers can also flexibly define agent interaction behaviors. Both natural language and computer code can be used to program flexible conversation patterns for different applications. AutoGen serves as a generic infrastructure to build diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in many example applications, with domains ranging from mathematics, coding, question answering, operations research, online decision-making, entertainment, etc.

Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4

Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions."""

# ## Learning new skills
# Finally, let's extend the teachable agent's capabilities by teaching it a new skill for accomplishing a challenging type of task. 
# 
# The [Sparks of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712) paper evaluated GPT-4 on math problems like the following, which it could only solve 32% of the time.

# In[12]:


text = """Consider the identity:

# This time, lets teach the agent a reliable strategy for solving such tasks.

-Let's think step-by-step, write down a plan, and then write down your solution as: "The solution is: A * B + C * D".

Here's some advice that may help:
1. Let E denote the original number on the right.
2. Let F denote the final number on the right.
3. Calculate the difference between the two, G = F - E.
4. Examine the numbers on the left one by one until finding one that divides evenly into G, where negative integers are allowed.
5. Calculate J = G / H. This is the number of times that H divides into G.
6. Verify that J is an integer, and that H * J = G.
7. Find the number on the left which is multiplied by H, and call it K.
8. Change K to K + J.
9. Recompute the value on the left, and verify that it equals F.
Finally, write down your solution as: "The solution is: A * B + C * D".

# When given this advice, GPT-4 can solve such problems over 95% of the time. But can the teachable agent remember the strategy so the user doesn't have to explain it over and over? As before, let's start a new chat to find out.
